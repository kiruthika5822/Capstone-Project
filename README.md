# Capstone-Project
Classifying fake News using machine learning algorithms

  The proliferation of misinformation and fake news in digital media poses a significant
challenge to society, affecting public discourse, political landscapes, and societal trust. In
response, this project aims to develop and deploy machine learning models for the automatic
classification of news articles as either real or fake. Leveraging a dataset of labelled news
articles, various classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, , Decision Trees, and
Random Forest are trained and evaluated.
  A comprehensive preprocessing pipeline is constructed to handle diverse feature types,
including textual content, metadata, and sentiment analysis. The pipeline incorporates
techniques such as TF-IDF vectorization, one-hot encoding, and standard scaling to transform
raw data into a format suitable for machine learning models.
Performance evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are utilized
to assess the models' effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news. Additionally,
confusion matrices and feature importance analysis provide insights into model behaviour
and feature relevance.
  Results indicate varying degrees of success across different models, with logistic regression
demonstrating robust performance in terms of accuracy and balanced precision-recall trade-
offs. Decision tree models showcase interpretability and depth control through cost
complexity pruning. However, the Random Forest model exhibits a bias towards the majority
class, necessitating further optimization.
  Overall, this project contributes to the ongoing efforts in combatting fake news by providing
a framework for automated classification, enabling the identification and mitigation of
misinformation at scale.
